# Unit5Notes
1. In the folder called "using_forms" is a flask app with its own template folder, a peewee model module and a form module.
2. I need to be able to read and write to a peewee db from a Flask template.
3. I seem to be able to read from the db file.
4. I can't seem to get my app to render the form template to post new entries to the db file.
5. What am I doing wrong?
