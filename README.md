# Personal Learning Journal with Flask
The password is "project5"

# Contents:
1. A flask app.
2. A templates folder.
3. A static folder.
4. A peewee models module.
5. A forms module.

# Current functionality:
1. User can read and write to a peewee db from a Flask template.
2. All entries display in html templates.

# Just did:
1. Updated templates.  Templates now respond properly to user's login status.

# Next steps:
1. Trying app out in my computer console, rather than Treehouse Workspaces.
2. Documenting which specific modules are needed to make app work.
3. Conform package around original coding of new.html and edit.html?
